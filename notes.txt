	- make blog width bigger
	- fix images list
	- give jason ability ti give alt tag for title image 
	-whys is listbucket function not working?
	- how can I make the page load faster? (I suspect the front image is what takes long so see how we can improve that)
	- need loader bars for the images
	- minify files

SEO:
	- we need out generate sitemaps xml
		- evertime jason adds a blog we should update the sitemap.xml

Week Work List:	
	- SEO for angularjs with work list for the two of us
	- about page needs (set max display on there)
	- Google Analytics
	- contact page with email
		
Calculator:
	5) loader bar needs to be the whole page
	
	- the numbers need commas for readability in the results page
	- whole row click for adding data in calculator is annoying and should be shorter 
	- cash on equity table when paid all cash creates really small increments for (cash on equity %), they should be large therefore creating a straight line   instead of confusing up and down
	- pie charts on the same line
	- dollar signs by pie charts
	- when add a field (such as utility and enter desc but not the other) it will show missing field but not highligth in red like the others




Backlog:
	- 
	- REST route should also authenticate user
	- prevent API attacks
	- add MOST POPULAR capability
	- db check for javascript?
	- Add replies to comments
	- Shared service calls might need to be providers
	- Admin table will need sorting and pagination
	- SASS for page colors
	- write jason tutorial on how large of pictures to used 
	- blogs should be able to be ordered (maybe look how owr is doing that)
	- pie charts on the same line	
	- do I still need jquery ui?

Before Go-Live
	- figure out how to optimized script loading (CDN, combining js files, etc.)
	- how to make loading faster? a loader for website?
	- minify all files before final deployment
