Where I left of:
- need to have a check that required fields only show when steps is activated

- test the functionality

What I am trying to do:
	- add errpr handling on what the service returns
	- #loaderbody: there should be a better way to call this
	- change the rental calculate to use service instead of scope 
	- do I still need jquery ui?
	- You need to add test handler

	- 
To Discuss with Jason:
	- color too neo like
	- color order should be different (especially the green shades)
	- I need testing that the color orders are right
	- 
Notes:
	- 

Worklist:
	- rentalCalculation directive split up instead of accessing divs

Before Go-Live
	- figure out how to optimized script loading (CDN, combining js files, etc.)
	- how to make loading faster? a loader for website?
	- minify all files before final deployment

Questions:

1) How much logic should be in directive, controller, service
loading performance on all the scripts
2) How do controller service and directive relate
	- how to get data from controller, or from service?
	- should directive get data from controller or service?

4) primitives in controller
5) which directive type to use
6) timeout, apply, always in directive link??
7) what if you want to add ids in the directive
8) e.g. progress bar click event which needs to be accessed by directive link but
   then how to get data or save data back into the view
   button click events
9) should a directive ever have access to a service
