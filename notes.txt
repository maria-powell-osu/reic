Where I left of:
	- if specialTermsLoan-interest-only = yes, amortization is not required
	- I still want to change the way the required fields get communicated
	- page should hop back on top when next button gets hit
 	

Worklist:
	- I Could probably create a shared directive for the different types of charts
	- I need to make the loader div go to the whole page even when scrolling
	- do I still need jquery ui?
	- You need to add test handler
	- optimize the add and remove data functions -- and other controller functions

	- 
To Discuss with Jason:
	- color too neo like
	- color order should be different (especially the green shades)
	- I need testing that the color orders are right
	- 
Notes:
	- 


Before Go-Live

	- how to make loading faster? a loader for website?
	- minify all files before final deployment

Questions:

1) How much logic should be in directive, controller, service
loading performance on all the scripts
2) How do controller service and directive relate
	- how to get data from controller, or from service?
	- should directive get data from controller or service?
		- e.g. slideshow, google charts
3) about the digest in apply, digest etc.
4) primitives in controller
5) which directive type to use
6) timeout, apply, always in directive link??

   then how to get data or save data back into the view
   button click events
9) should a directive ever have access to a service
