Where I left of:
 	- BLOG BUGdeleted the top one and it visually took out another one but actually deleted the right onw
	- remove imagge blob should disapprea too
	- make blog width bigger
	- fix images list
	- give jason ability ti give alt tag for title image 
	-whys is listbucket function not working?
	- how can I make the page load faster? (I suspect the front image is what takes long so see how we can improve that)
	- need loader bars for the images

Week Work List:	
	- SEO for angularjs with work list for the two of us
	- about page needs (set max display on there)
	- Google Analytics
	- contact page with email
		
Calculator:

	4) why is the chart getting small?
		- have the table result open
		- change income amount
		- go back to results tab and change the view to graph instead of table
	5) loader bar needs to be the whole page
	6) change assumed values bar color
	7) make the buttons look like they toggles
	2) down payment needs to be rounded for % and $...check if the others are doing the same thing
	3) at the bottom need nexts without scrolling
	8) remove gauge and instead do the same thing as for cashflow above
		- CASHFLOW: Total net income in:
		- RETURN: Total profit in: (appr, cashflow, loadn paydown)
	- whole row click for adding data in calculator is annoying and should be shorter 
	- cash on equity table when paid all cash creates really small increments for (cash on equity %), they should be large therefore creating a straight line   instead of confusing up and down
	- pie charts on the same line
	- dollar signs by pie charts


DONE:
1) cap rate indicator without judgment: ( (sum( pie chart incomes) - sum( pie chart expenses) )*12) / purchase price
- maintenance cost default to 10 instead of 3
2) monthly income - monthly expenses - mortgage(loan pmt) = +green, -red Cash flow
3) get rid of the gauge for cashflow and replace with "How much did I make in: 5 yrs, 15yrs, 30yrs," 
4) What is your house worth in 30years from now? to label calculator
1)for total return, include profits from forced appreciation from CAPEX
		- if this is not done today, get specifics from jason 



Backlog:
	
	-prevent API attacks
	- add MOST POPULAR capability
	- db check for javascript?
	- Add replies to comments
	- Shared service calls might need to be providers
	- Admin table will need sorting and pagination
	- SASS for page colors
	- write jason tutorial on how large of pictures to used 
	- blogs should be able to be ordered (maybe look how owr is doing that)
	- pie charts on the same line	
	- do I still need jquery ui?

Before Go-Live
	- figure out how to optimized script loading (CDN, combining js files, etc.)
	- how to make loading faster? a loader for website?
	- minify all files before final deployment
