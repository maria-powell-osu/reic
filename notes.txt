Where I left of:
	1) add hover to calculator icons
	2) Need a remove image for updates and such 
	2) Finish Picture upload, download, delete
	3) Display Blogs on page
		- For website add email link comments
	4) Turn this API into truly REST API (json validation, input validation, response code etc.)
	5) - Shared service calls might need to be providers
		- I bet there is a better way to setup services
	6) Preview button for jason blogs page?

	- banner stuff in css in media tag could be removed
		
Backlog:
	- SASS for page colors
	- write jason tutorial on how large of pictures to used 
	- blogs should be able to be ordered (maybe look how owr is doing that)
	- cap rate round to nearest 10th
	- navigation bar needs to close from site
	- instead of 5 year avg do just the first year (cash on cash ROI) 
	- the downpayment percent should always stay the same no matter what
	- pie charts on the same line
	- cap rate indicator without judgment: ( (sum( pie chart incomes) - sum( pie chart expenses) )*12) / purchase price
	- monthly income - monthly expenses - mortgage(loan pmt) = +green, -red
	- design front page sliders
	- comment service with gae
	- show the loader on the whole page
	- discuss the scale with jason and the overtime step
	- typical Cap rate on area - discuss with Jason
	- required fields have to have better coloring to indicate missing
	- why is the chart getting small>?
	- if specialTermsLoan-interest-only = yes, amortization is not required
 	

Worklist:
	- make navbar collapse by itself
	- I Could probably create a shared directive for the different types of charts
	- I need to make the loader div go to the whole page even when scrolling
	- do I still need jquery ui?
	- You need to add test handler
	- optimize the add and remove data functions -- and other controller functions

Before Go-Live
	- figure out how to optimized script loading (CDN, combining js files, etc.)
	- how to make loading faster? a loader for website?
	- minify all files before final deployment

Questions:

1) How much logic should be in directive, controller, service
loading performance on all the scripts
2) How do controller service and directive relate
	- how to get data from controller, or from service?
	- should directive get data from controller or service?
		- e.g. slideshow, google charts
3) about the digest in apply, digest etc.
4) primitives in controller
5) which directive type to use
6) timeout, apply, always in directive link??
7) what if you want to add ids in the directive
8) e.g. progress bar click event which needs to be accessed by directive link but
   then how to get data or save data back into the view
   button click events
9) should a directive ever have access to a service
10) what if the controller get it from the service and hands it to directive
